# Code and data for our paper in JPCL "One-Shot Trajectory Learning of Open Quantum Systems Dynamics"
 https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpclett.2c01242
 
 With train_your_model.py, you can train the CNN model 
 and aftrer training you can use run_dynamics.py to predict dynamics for the test trajectories
 
 Training data, test trajectories and already_trained_model are provided at
